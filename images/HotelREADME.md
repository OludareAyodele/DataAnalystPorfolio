#** Hotel Reservation Analysis**
## Project Overview
The Hotel Reservation Analysis aims to understand booking patterns, pricing strategies, and customer preferences by analysing various factors such as booking status, lead time, parking space requirements, average room prices, market segments, and arrival months. This analysis will help hotel managers and marketers develop better pricing strategies, optimize room occupancy, and enhance customer satisfaction.
## Objectives
-	To analyse the distribution of booking statuses and identify key factors influencing booking confirmations and cancellations.
-	To evaluate the relationship between booking lead time and booking status.
-	To examine the demand for parking spaces among different customer segments.
-	To analyse how average room prices influence booking statuses.
-	To identify the market segments and their associated average room prices.
-	To understand seasonal trends in bookings based on arrival months.
## Data Source
The analysis utilizes a dataset containing information on hotel bookings, including booking status, lead time, parking space requirements, average room prices, market segments, and arrival months. The data was collected from various hotels over a period of two years.
## Tools
- SQL
- TABLEAU 
## Data Cleaning / Preparation
Initial data cleaning involved handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Data was standardized and normalized as required.

## Key insights 
1.	Higher average room prices were associated with a lower booking confirmation rate, indicating price sensitivity among customers.
2.	A significant proportion of bookings cancelled were as a result of inadequate parking space.
3.	The majority of bookings were made through online which has 63.99% of the total booking, followed by offline segment with 29.02% and then corporate segment with 5.56 and then others.
4.	Bookings made with well in advance lead times had higher cancellation rates compared to those made in shorter lead time. The longer the lead time, the higher the chances of cancellation.

## Recommendations
1.	Dynamic Pricing Strategies: Implement dynamic pricing strategies to adjust room prices based on lead time and booking demand.
2.	Targeted Marketing: Develop targeted marketing campaigns for different market segments, focusing on their specific needs and price sensitivities.
3.	Parking Space Management: Optimize parking space allocation based on demand patterns observed in different market segments.
4.	Seasonal Promotions: Introduce seasonal promotions to boost bookings during off-peak months and maximize revenue during peak periods. 
## Conclusion
The Hotel Reservation Analysis project provides valuable insights into customer booking behaviours, pricing strategies, and seasonal trends. By understanding these factors, hotel managers can optimize room occupancy, enhance customer satisfaction, and increase revenue. Future work could involve a deeper analysis of customer feedback and preferences to further refine marketing and operational strategies.
