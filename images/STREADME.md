# **Students Performance Analysis**

## Project Overview
The Student Performance Analysis project aims to evaluate and understand the factors affecting student performance in educational institutions. By analysing various data points, this project seeks to identify trends, patterns, and correlations that can inform strategies to improve student outcomes and overall academic performance.
## Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis is the students data file containing information about the students academic performance records of a school.
## Tools
Power BI and Power query
## Data Cleaning / Preparation
Initial data cleaning involved handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Data was standardized and normalized as required.

## Key insights 
1.	The insights reveal that Students who received free or reduced-price lunch programs tended to have lower overall results compared to those who paid for lunch (as 81% of failed students fall under this category). This suggests that socioeconomic status, as indicated by lunch payment status, greatly have impact on academic performance.
2.	Gender analysis showed that male students slightly performed better than female students in overall results.
3.	There were noticeable differences in overall results across different ethnic groups. Some ethnic groups outperformed others, indicating potential disparities in educational outcomes.
4.	Finally, the report identifies that student whose parents had higher levels of education achieved higher overall results. This indicates that parental education level is positively correlated with student academic performance..

## Recommendations
1.   Support for Low-Income Students: Develop programs to support students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, including tutoring and financial assistance.
2.  Addressing Ethnic Disparities: Implement inclusive teaching strategies and provide additional resources to underperforming ethnic groups.
3. Parental Engagement: Increase parental involvement and provide resources to help parents support their childrenâ€™s education, regardless of their own educational background.
