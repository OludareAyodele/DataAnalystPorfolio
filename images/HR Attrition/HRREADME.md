# **HR Attrition Analysis**

## Project Overview
The aim of this dashboard is to provide insights into the company's attrition rates, identify departments and employee groups with the highest attrition rates, and highlight factors contributing to employee turnover. The dashboard is intended to help the company's management team make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention and reduce attrition rates. The insights can be used to develop targeted retention strategies, revise compensation packages, implement mentorship or career development programs, and review job roles and responsibilities to improve employee satisfaction and retention. 
This report analyses the attrition rates and the factors that contribute to employee turnover within a company of 780 employees.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis is the employee attrition data file containing information about the attrition rate of a company.
## Tools
Excel
## Data Cleaning / Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following;
1. Data Loading and Inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data Cleaning and Formatting.

## Key insights 
1.	The insights reveal that the total attrition rate across the entire company is 30%, with the HR department having the highest attrition rate, followed by Finance, Sales, Marketing and IT.
2.	Young adults between the ages of 26-35 have the highest total of attrition, with a total of 156.
3.	The chart shows that employee with poor performance rating followed by Average performance rating and Fair performance rating, have the highest employee attrition rates. The report concludes that the more the employees are dissatisfied with their performance, the higher the attrition.
4.	Finally, the report identifies Specialist, Engineer and Analyst as having high attrition rates, indicating a need to review their performance rating and responsibilities to improve employee satisfaction and retention.

## Recommendations
1. I recommend diving into the root causes of employee poor performance.
2. I recommend setting flexible Key Performance Index (KPI) to boost employee satisfaction and retention.
3. Focus on organizing periodic training programs to improve the performance of the employee.
