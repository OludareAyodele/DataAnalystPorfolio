# **Breast Cancer Analysis**

## Project Overview
The Breast Cancer Analysis project aims to investigate the relationships between various factors such as insurance payment status, tumour stages, types of surgery, surgery dates, patient status, and age groups. Understanding these relationships is crucial for identifying trends and improving the management and treatment of breast cancer patients.
## Objectives:
-	To analyse the correlation between insurance payment status and patient outcomes.
-	To examine the distribution of tumour stages across different types of surgery.
-	To explore the relationship between the date of surgery and patient status.
-	To investigate patient status by tumour stage.
-	To analyse age group distributions among patients and their corresponding health outcomes.

## Data Source
The analysis utilizes a dataset containing information on patient insurance payment status, tumour stages, types of surgery, dates of surgery, patient status, and age groups. This data was collected from multiple healthcare institutions over a period of four years.
## Tools
SQL and TABLEAU
## Data Cleaning / Preparation
Initial data cleaning involved handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Data was standardized and normalized as required.

## Key insights 
1. The insights reveal that early-stage tumours (stages I and II) were more likely to be treated with less invasive surgeries such as lumpectomies, while late-stage tumours (stages III) required more extensive surgeries like mastectomies.
2.	Patients who underwent surgery within three months of diagnosis had better outcomes than those who had delayed surgeries.
3. There was a clear correlation between tumour stage at diagnosis and patient survival rates, with earlier stages showing significantly higher survival.
4. Younger patients (age 20-40) had better recovery rates compared to older patients (age 60+), likely due to fewer comorbidities and higher resilience.
5. Finally, Patients with comprehensive insurance coverage showed better health outcomes and higher survival rates compared to those with limited or no insurance.

## Recommendations
1.	 Insurance Coverage: Advocate for better insurance coverage and support programs to improve patient outcomes.
2.	Early Detection and Treatment: Emphasize the importance of early detection and timely surgery to enhance survival rates.
3.	Tailored Treatment Plans: Develop tailored treatment plans based on tumour stage and patient demographics to optimize outcomes.
4.	Support for Older Patients: Provide additional support and resources for older breast cancer patients to improve their recovery rates.

## Conclusion 
The Breast Cancer Analysis project provides valuable insights into the factors affecting patient outcomes. By understanding the relationships between insurance, tumour stages, surgery types, and patient demographics, healthcare providers can develop more effective treatment plans and policies. Future research could involve longitudinal studies to track patient outcomes over time and investigate the impact of new treatment modalities.
