# **Bank Customers Churn Analysis**

## Project Overview
This Bank churn analysis was conducted to identify the factors contributing to a high churn rate among bank customers. The analysis revealed that the churn rate among 10,000 customers was 20.38%, with a higher churn rate among customers with the satisfactory rate of 3 and below. Additionally, customers who had complained about the services of the bank are the one leaving, 2034 out of 2038 customers churns complained. The total number of churns from customers in the tenures of 5 years and above was the highest. 
The analysis also showed that the majority of the churns customers were aged between 40-60, with slightly more female customers than males. The majority of the churns customers are single product customers.

Overall, this bank churn analysis provides valuable insights into the factors contributing to high churn rates and highlights areas where the company could focus its efforts to reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction.

 3. 	Are there any patterns or trends in the data that indicate certain customer segments are more likely to churn than others?.
 4. 	Are there any correlations between the number of products a customer has with the bank and their likelihood of churning?.
 5. 	How does the tenure of a customer with the bank affect their likelihood of churning?
